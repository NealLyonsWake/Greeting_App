# Greetings!
This is my greetings app. This is an exercise for working through a Git workflow on code.
The only thing to be added are new greetings in the greetingArray array which future iterations can demonstrate. These are added in various branches away from master to demonstrate the different merge types in Git.

The user clicks the button to generate a random greeting. Enjoy :)
